      "14  counts for:  Because of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company’s financial condition and operating results, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods.\n",
      "6  counts for:  Global and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the Company.\n",

      "8  counts for:  Demand also could differ materially from the Company’s expectations as a result of currency fluctuations because the Company generally raises prices on goods and services sold outside the U.S. to correspond with the effect of a strengthening of the U.S. dollar.\n",
      "10  counts for:  Other factors that could influence worldwide or regional demand include changes in fuel and other energy costs, conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets, unemployment, labor and healthcare costs, access to credit, consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors affecting consumer spending behavior.\n",

      "16  counts for:  The Company’s products and services compete in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price cutting and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price/performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors and price sensitivity on the part of consumers.\n",
      "10  counts for:  The Company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on its ability to ensure a continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace.\n",

      "7  counts for:  The Company currently holds a significant number of patents and copyrights and has registered and/or has applied to register numerous patents, trademarks and service marks.\n",
      "8  counts for:  In contrast, many of the Company’s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and emulating the Company's products and infringing on its intellectual property.\n",
      "15  counts for:  If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the Company’s intellectual property, the Company’s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be adversely affected.\n",

      "12  counts for:  The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and digital content supplier relationships.\n",
      "2  counts for:  and the Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone market.\n",
      "13  counts for:  Additionally, the Company faces significant price competition as competitors reduce their selling prices and attempt to imitate the Company’s product features and applications within their own products or, alternatively, collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer.\n",
      "1  counts for:  The Company competes with business models that provide content to users for free.\n",
      "4  counts for:  The Company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications.\n",
      "5  counts for:  Some of the Company’s competitors have greater experience, product breadth and distribution channels than the Company.\n",
      "5  counts for:  Because some current and potential competitors have substantial resources and/or experience and a lower cost structure, they may be able to provide products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss.\n",
      "12  counts for:  The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors attempt to imitate the Company’s approach to providing components seamlessly within their individual offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions.\n",
      "11  counts for:  The Company’s financial condition and operating results depend substantially on the Company’s ability to continually improve iOS and iOS devices in order to maintain their functional and design advantages.\n",
      "5  counts for:  The Company is the only authorized maker of hardware using macOS, which has a minority market share in the personal computer market.\n",
      "4  counts for:  This market has been contracting and is dominated by computer makers using competing operating systems, most notably Windows.\n",
      "7  counts for:  In the market for personal computers and accessories, the Company faces a significant number of competitors, many of which have broader product lines, lower priced products and a larger installed customer base.\n",
      "3  counts for:  Historically, consolidation in this market has resulted in larger competitors.\n",
      "4  counts for:  Price competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins.\n",
      "8  counts for:  An increasing number of internet-enabled devices that include software applications and are smaller and simpler than traditional personal computers compete for market share with the Company’s existing products.\n",
      "8  counts for:  The Company’s financial condition and operating results also depend on its ability to continually improve the Mac platform to maintain its functional and design advantages.\n",
      "4  counts for:  There can be no assurance the Company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively.\n",
      "7  counts for:  To remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent product introductions and transitions.\n",
      "13  counts for:  Due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the Company competes, the Company must continually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products.\n",
      "22  counts for:  The success of new product introductions depends on a number of factors including, but not limited to, timely and successful product development, market acceptance, the Company’s ability to manage the risks associated with new product production ramp-up issues, the availability of application software for new products, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects or deficiencies in the early stages of introduction.\n",
      "6  counts for:  Accordingly, the Company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product introductions and transitions.\n",
      "5  counts for:  The Company depends on the performance of distributors, carriers and other resellers.\n",
      "10  counts for:  The Company distributes its products through cellular network carriers, wholesalers, national and regional retailers and value-added resellers, many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers.\n",
      "8  counts for:  The Company also sells its products and third-party products in most of its major markets directly to education, enterprise and government customers and consumers and small and mid-sized businesses through its online and retail stores.\n",
      "3  counts for:  Some carriers providing cellular network service for iPhone subsidize users’ purchases of the device.\n",
      "10  counts for:  There is no assurance that such subsidies will be continued at all or in the same amounts upon renewal of the Company’s agreements with these carriers or in agreements the Company enters into with new carriers.\n",
      "4  counts for:  Many resellers have been adversely affected in the past by weak economic conditions.\n",
      "7  counts for:  The Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing selected resellers’ stores with Company employees and contractors, and improving product placement displays.\n",
      "5  counts for:  These programs could require a substantial investment while providing no assurance of return or incremental revenue.\n",
      "10  counts for:  The financial condition of these resellers could weaken, these resellers could stop distributing the Company’s products, or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the Company’s products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company’s products.\n",
      "6  counts for:  The Company faces substantial inventory and other asset risk in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk.\n",
      "9  counts for:  The Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand or net realizable value and accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components.\n",
      "11  counts for:  The Company also reviews its long-lived assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers’ facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.\n",
      "3  counts for:  If the Company determines that impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair value.\n",
      "16  counts for:  Although the Company believes its provisions related to inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently adequate, no assurance can be given that the Company will not incur additional related charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company competes.\n",
      "4  counts for:  The Company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments.\n",
      "6  counts for:  Consistent with industry practice, components are normally acquired through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts and open orders, in each case based on projected demand.\n",
      "7  counts for:  Manufacturing purchase obligations typically cover forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods up to 150 days.\n",
      "10  counts for:  Because the Company’s markets are volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments.\n",
      "8  counts for:  Future operating results depend upon the Company’s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms.\n",
      "5  counts for:  Because the Company currently obtains components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks.\n",
      "8  counts for:  Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.\n",
      "7  counts for:  While the Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all.\n",
      "15  counts for:  A number of suppliers of components may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting the Company’s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms.\n",
      "14  counts for:  The effects of global or regional economic conditions on the Company’s suppliers, described in “Global and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the Company” above, also could affect the Company’s ability to obtain components.\n",
      "3  counts for:  Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases.\n",
      "4  counts for:  The Company’s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source.\n",
      "7  counts for:  When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased.\n",
      "12  counts for:  Continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected for any number of reasons, including if those suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements.\n",
      "3  counts for:  The supply of components for a new or existing product could be delayed or constrained, or a key manufacturing vendor could delay shipments of completed products to the Company.\n",
      "4  counts for:  The Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners, many of which are located outside of the U.S.\n",
      "4  counts for:  Substantially all of the Company’s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by a few outsourcing partners located primarily in Asia.\n",
      "4  counts for:  The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management.\n",
      "5  counts for:  While these arrangements may lower operating costs, they also reduce the Company’s direct control over production and distribution.\n",
      "7  counts for:  It is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of products or services, or the Company’s flexibility to respond to changing conditions.\n",
      "12  counts for:  Although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement, the Company may remain responsible to the consumer for warranty service in the event of product defects and could experience an unanticipated product defect or warranty liability.\n",
      "5  counts for:  While the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, material violations of the supplier code of conduct could occur.\n",
      "8  counts for:  The Company relies on sole-sourced outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture many critical components, and on outsourcing partners primarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the Company’s hardware products.\n",
      "3  counts for:  Any failure of these partners to perform may have a negative impact on the Company’s cost or supply of components or finished goods.\n",
      "14  counts for:  In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations may be disrupted for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures, commercial disputes, military actions or economic, business, labor, environmental, public health, or political issues.\n",
      "7  counts for:  The Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements.\n",
      "10  counts for:  While these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods, if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply could be reduced or terminated and the net realizable value of these assets could be negatively impacted.\n",
      "6  counts for:  The Company’s products and services may experience quality problems from time to time that can result in decreased sales and operating margin and harm to the Company’s reputation.\n",
      "2  counts for:  The Company sells complex hardware and software products and services that can contain design and manufacturing defects.\n",
      "7  counts for:  Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those sold by the Company, often contain “bugs” that can unexpectedly interfere with the software’s intended operation.\n",
      "3  counts for:  The Company’s online services may from time to time experience outages, service slowdowns, or errors.\n",

      "10  counts for:  Any such costs, which may rise in the future as a result of changes in these laws and regulations or in their interpretation, could individually or in the aggregate make the Company’s products and services less attractive to the Company’s customers, delay the introduction of new products in one or more regions, or cause the Company to change or limit its business practices.\n",

      "10  counts for:  Such events could decrease demand for the Company’s products, make it difficult or impossible for the Company to make and deliver products to its customers, including channel partners, or to receive components from its suppliers, and create delays and inefficiencies in the Company’s supply chain.\n",

      "12  counts for:  In addition, the Company’s gross margin and operating margin percentages, as well as overall profitability, may be materially adversely impacted as a result of a shift in product, geographic or channel mix, component cost increases, the strengthening U.S. dollar, price competition, or the introduction of new products, including those that have higher cost structures with flat or reduced pricing.\n",
      "5  counts for:  The Company has typically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters due in part to seasonal holiday demand.\n",

      "12  counts for:  Weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Company’s foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing demand for the Company’s products.\n",

      "14  counts for:  Conversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the Company’s foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit.\n",
      "7  counts for:  Additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may also increase the Company’s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins.\n",
      "7  counts for:  The Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\n",
